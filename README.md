# Etch Notation

Etch ~~Notation~~ is a simple, responsive theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a focus on writing (as well as reading). This theme is a fork of my favorite Hugo theme, [Etch](https://lukasjoswiak.github.io/etch/), due to the simplicity. Great thanks for Lukas!

## Features:

* Homepage with list of posts.
* Support for pages.
* Responsive design for optimized mobile experience.
* Syntax highlighting with customizable theme.
* ~~Dark~~ Sepia theme which automatically adjusts based on users' setting ([example](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch/wiki/Dark-mode)).
* No external dependencies, ~~no JavaScript~~, no web fonts.
* **Using [rough-notation](https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough-notation) JavaScript for writing annotation.**
* Internationalization friendly: use default English translations or create your own
* **Support pagination, set from `config.toml`**

It's hard to me to use similar color palette for notation in both light and dark theme at once. Thus, Etch Notation is using Sepia color scheme instead of black/gray in dark mode.

The [`404.html`](https://akherlan.github.io/nothere) page style has stolen from `etch-academic`, another etch-family theme by √Ålvaro Carril. I configure it for supporting multi-language translations . Etch Academic is available as a theme on [this repository](https://github.com/acarril/etch-academic/).

## Notation

The annotation formatting on posts can be accessed via `shortcode` on your Markdown files by using 	`annotate` and its parameters `class` and `text`.

```
{{< annotate class="highlight" text="your highlighted text" >}}
```

There are 5 types (classes) of annotations available for writing:

* `highlight` to marking text in highlighter/marker pen style (default annotation)
* `underline` to emphasize the text with underline
* `strike` to strike through the text in the middle
* `cross` to cross out the text with an x sign
* `circle` to round the circle on the text

All the mark types are using pen style except for `highlight` which is using marker pen style. The annotations support multi-line rendering which means it will be rendered as a separating object while the text is too long on paragraph. However, it is not applied to `circle`.

Basic HTML tags like `<mark>`, `<ins>` (underline), and `<del>` which is generated by tilde `~` in markdown will also rendered as notation style.

### Usage examples

Annotating text with default `highlight` and HTML tag `<mark>`.

```
Using {{< annotate "highlight" >}} annotation rather than basic <mark>`<mark>`</mark> HTML tag is cool.
```

Annotating text with `circle` and parameter names.

```
This is an example of {{< annotate class="circle" text="a target word" >}} in a sentence.
```

Annotating text with `underline` based on the order of parameters placement without parameter names.

```
It can also use {{< annotate underline "underlined text to emphasize" >}} important thoughts.
```

Annotating text with `cross` for multiple words and `strike` for a single word.

```
The {{< annotate "cross" "cross mark" >}} is used as well as a {{< annotate strike strike-through>}} on texts to be excluded them while reading.
```

That's it!
